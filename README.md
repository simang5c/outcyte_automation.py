Outcyte (http://www.outcyte.com/) is for predicting unconventionally secreted proteins. Imagine you have thousands of protein sequences which needs to be predicted, in that case manually submitting one file after anothe with limited number of sequences becomes tedious. For such reason we require automation.

# How to run?
To run the program just download it and run it where you have your multiple fasta files stored.
